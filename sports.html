   <p>Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, released a video on Monday revealing the extensive measures aimed at preventing doping during next year's World Cup.

Infantino, presumably, hopes that a program he says will test every player on each of the 32 teams will be enough to ensure that the shadow of doping does not taint the event.

If only it was that simple.

Doping and the upcoming World Cup are inextricably linked for a few simple reasons. The competition is to be held in Russia, starting in June. The host nation, naturally, is participating. And, according to claims from the same whistleblower whose testimony could see Russia thrown out of February’s Winter Olympics, Russian soccer was a point of focus for a state-sponsored doping program across dozens of sports.

Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Russia’s now-discredited anti-doping lab, turned on his former employers and gave evidence about how he and others, reporting to senior Russian political figures, illegally conspired to tamper with urine samples to cover up doping protocols.


The extent of the cheating, according to the wide-ranging McLaren report that was commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and investigated the Russian scandal, insisted that soccer was part of the “state-sponsored” Russian doping program.

However, FIFA has made no attempt to contact Rodchenkov in order to seek more information about his claims, Rodchenkov’s United States-based attorney Jim Walden confirmed to USA TODAY Sports on Monday.

Surely it is worth a look, right? WADA considered Rodchenkov’s assertions to be a smoking gun that cut to the heart of the Russian political system. The Paralympic movement felt the allegations to be credible enough to ban the entire Russian team from Rio in 2016. And the International Olympic Committee is mulling whether to allow Russia to participate in Pyeongchang at the Winter Games or to keep its team out altogether.

In banning five more Winter Olympic athletes for life on Monday, the IOC’s disciplinary committee described Rodchenkov, the subject of the Netflix documentary Icarus and now in hiding in the U.S., as a “truthful witness.”

But apparently still not, for FIFA and Infantino, worth talking to. Let’s just put out a video instead.

“Speaking about doping, obviously, all players in all teams will be tested in competition and out of competition and we are sure that everyone is well aware of this situation,” Infantino said.

Well, that’s great. Remember how the level of cheating in Russia was so developed in Sochi in 2014 that it read like a spy thriller? Testing wasn’t enough then because the tests were flawed and counter-intelligence operatives were used to fudge the results.

The whole thing is a monumental headache for FIFA, which must know that if it scratches the surface it is not going to like what it finds.

“Dr. Rodchenkov has been fully cooperative with those who sought his assistance and evidence,” Walden said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports. “Given the rampant corruption in sports, it is clear that many would prefer to keep their heads buried.”

FIFA’s head is buried deep. The soccer body’s primary problem is the extent to which political factors are wrapped up in all this. Russia’s deputy prime minister and Vladimir Putin’s right-hand man is Vitaly Mutko, who is also the head of the World Cup organizing committee. And also, one of the primary figures implicated by Rodchenko as masterminding the extensive doping campaign.

The IOC can pull Russia from Pyeongchang and the impact is tricky, but not devastating. Remove Russia from the World Cup, and there is no World Cup in Russia, and no time to move it somewhere else.

Which leaves things in limbo, with soccer and its chiefs looking weak on doping, the World Cup host sitting accused of doping infractions, potentially damning information remaining overlooked and the tournament itself rapidly approaching.

The draw for the World Cup will be held on Friday at the Kremlin. The whole sorry saga doesn’t figure to be much clearer by then, or by next summer, and perhaps not at all.</p>
