# Nepal-Internship
Sophomore Seminar Project (Currently Working)
“Nepal Internships” is a centralized platform where students can sign up for an account, look for internships, and choose to apply to either specific internship or create a common application to send to multiple companies or organizations which provide internship opportunities to the interested students.

The front end of the project “Nepal Internships” will be implemented using  HTML, CSS, and Javascript whereas  the backend will be implemented using Google App Engine in python.
