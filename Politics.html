    <h1>Trump has no plans to campaign for Roy Moore, White House says</h1>
   <center> <textarea rows="4" cols="50"> WASHINGTON – President Trump does not plan to travel to Alabama to campaign for embattled Senate candidate Roy Moore, a White House official said Monday.

"The president is not planning any trip to Alabama at this time," White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. "And, frankly, his schedule doesn't permit him doing anything between now and Election Day." 

Trump, who has all but endorsed Moore despite multiple sexual assault and harassment accusations against him, told reporters last week he would decide soon whether to campaign for the Alabama Republican in person ahead of the Dec. 12 election. 

Trump has defended Moore, who has denied the allegations that he assaulted or pursued relationships with teenage girls while he was in his 30s. Trump has cited Moore's denials – and repeatedly bashed Moore's opponent, Democratic nominee Doug Jones.

Over the weekend, Trump said Jones would be a "puppet" of national Democrats such as Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California. 

"The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY," Trump wrote from during his Thanksgiving weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla.</textarea><center>
